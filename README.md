# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection

In healthcare, diabetic retinopathy detection is generally a manual process that involves a
trained physician examining color fundus retina images. This introduces a delay in the
process of diagnosis, often leading to delayed treatment. As a part of our project, we are
going to build a robust artificial intelligence system that can take the color fundus images of
the retina and classify the severity of the condition of the retina, with respect to diabetic
retinopathy. The different conditions into which we are going to classify the retina images
are as follows:

* 0: No diabetic retinopathy
* 1: Mild diabetic retinopathy
* 2: Moderate diabetic retinopathy
* 3: Severe diabetic retinopathy
* 4: Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
